# mapPlot

This project is to set up a system for producing maps of observations of species based on latitude and longitude

The goal is to make it as automated as possible so that it is very easy to generate a map of the relevant area, along with colour coded sighting data

The project has been deployed as on online map at https://www.shinyapps.io/admin/#/dashboard according to the protocol described here
